A small team wants an activity tracker to better understand how users interact with their platform. They want “something simple” that can be extended later. There is no existing system yet.
They’ve asked you to build a basic version and make reasonable assumptions where details are missing.

High-Level Goal
Create a backend service that records and retrieves user activities.

What is an “activity”?

That’s up to you to define, but it should at least:
- Belong to a user
- Represent something the user did
- Have some notion of time
Anything beyond that is your decision.

Your service should:
- Accept activity data
    - How activities are sent is up to you (API, file input, etc.)
    - Validation rules are not fully specified
- Store activities
    - Storage method is your choice (in-memory, file, database, etc.)
- Allow retrieval of activities
    - Activities should be retrievable “in a useful way”
    - Filtering and sorting are optional but encouraged
    - Be reasonably structured
    - Code should be readable and organised
    - Someone else should be able to extend it later

Requirements:
	•	Code should be clean, organised, and well-documented.
	•	Include instructions on how to run the project.
	•	Focus on functionality, usability, and clarity.
	•	Create a short video explaining the flow of the task completed.
	•	Git Hub Repo
Time Limit: 24 hours
